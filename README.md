- Pick a username, and a colour(pick any colour that has a "name" and not RGB values, for example "green","yellow","blue","cyan","red","purple",etc)
- Once you pick a username and colour, ready up on the current client, and then register on the other client.
- Once you have ready up on both clients, press "start game" on either clients it will work either way. You need at least two
- I made my shooting the stone in a "catapult style" , so please starting shooting from below the stone or beginning of the bottom of the stone.
- Once you shoot the ball, both canvases update and the new motion is shown on all browsers that are watching.
- the rest of the assignment is basically the physics part, which I don't need to explain since its shown.

-Note:
Always open all browsers at the same time if you want to see the movements ,viewing, and in order to start the game you need at least 2 players. Follow the instructions above.
